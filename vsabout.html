<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Vincent, cruising through the automotive world since 2007. After graduating, I jumped into various roles in different automotive dealerships, exploring my passion for the industry.

  In 2015, I found my sweet spot at Toyota, where I've been ever since. Consistently exceeding sales targets and building connections with customers, it's been a fulfilling ride. Beyond cars, I'm diving into the coding scene, exploring full-stack web development on my own.
  
  When I'm not on the screen, you'll find me knee-deep in video games, where strategy and problem-solving are my go-to relaxation. Away from work, my heart belongs to my amazing wife and our little dynamo of a son. They're my rock, my cheerleaders, and the reason behind all the late-night coding sessions.
  
  Excited to merge my love for tech with my knack for connecting with people, all while enjoying the ride. Catch you around!</p>
